# ColorBeats
A simple, easy way for you to turn your favorite song visual! Built to recognize sound and beat, this program designs a series of patterns to a song or tune in real-time and displays them through colorful LED lights.

This project was inspired by the beautiful Christmas lights in malls or in front of people's homes that light up to music. However, those patterns are hard-coded to specific songs and require much time and effort to complete each one. We wanted to build something that emcompasses greater flexibility and an easier setup that would reach a wider range of customers. To implement this, we analyzed the frequencies and amplitudes of the closest sound source using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) on an Arduino to determine the beat and structure of the song. This allowed us to search through and pull from a library of constructed patterns to fit the tempo and output it to a display of LED lights on a breadboard. Currently we are working on getting around the RAM limit of the Arduino so that it would be posisble to save songs and the light patterns created for them.
